## Round-trip Engineering for TinyOS applications (RTE4TinyOS)
This repository contains the project folders for the roundtrip engineering for TinyOS applications.
The folder **dsml4tinyos** is for the forward engineering framework. DSML4TinyOS has four main parts: the metamodel, the Acceleo generation engine and the Sirius graphical editor.
Eclipse Oxygen3 was used to develop this environment.

Steps for using DSML4TinyOS:
1. Extract the `tinyos.metamodel.zip`
1. Import the project to the Eclipse.
1. Run the project with `Run Configuration -> Eclipse Application` and import the extracted folder from `tinyos.sirius.zip` in the new Eclipse window with the Sirius perspective. Then, you can create a project for modeling the TinyOS application. 
1. You can use Acceleo code generation provided in the project by running `Run Configuration -> Acceleo Application `, providing your modeled TinyOS application, and then generating the code for that application.

The folder **re4tinyos** contains the reverse engineering tool files.
Eclipse Luna Release (4.4.0) was used to develop the RE4TinyOS environment.

Stpes to use the RE4TinyOS:
1. You can run the `run.jar` directly, read TinyOS applications as input, and then get the parsed models for those applications.
1. The folder `project.zip` contains the source code and includes the required dependencies (Antlr4.7.2, Antlr4.4, xml-apis)

The **example** folder contains all the artefacts and original codes for the applications used to evaluate the approach.
